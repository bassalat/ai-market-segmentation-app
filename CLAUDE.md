- **JSON Export**: Machine-readable data for CRM integration
- **Visual Elements**: Charts, competitor tables, methodology explanations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Claude API Prompts
- **Market Analysis Prompt**: Requests TAM, insights, trends, growth factors, CAGR, urgencies, competitors
- **Segmentation Prompt**: Generates 4-6 segments with characteristics, pain points, use cases, role mapping
- **Persona Prompt**: Creates detailed personas with demographics and psychographics
- **Currency Standardization**: All monetary values explicitly converted to USD

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Data Collection**: User inputs + automated web search
2. **Market Analysis**: Claude analyzes industry landscape
3. **Segment Identification**: AI pattern recognition and clustering
4. **Persona Development**: Individual segment deep-dive
5. **Strategy Development**: Implementation roadmap and metrics

### UI/UX Enhancements
- **TAM Display**: 2-box horizontal layout (Current Market + 2029 Projection)
- **Gradient Boxes**: Purple/blue for current, green for projections
- **Dynamic Values**: Smart regex parsing of TAM text
- **Growth Calculations**: Auto-calculated percentage growth
- **Clean Formatting**: Removed markdown formatting, fixed text issues

## Recent Fixes and Improvements

### Priority Matrix Redesign
- **Issue**: Degenerate vertical strip due to identical scores
- **Solution**: Multi-factor scoring system with proper variance
- **Result**: Genuine 2D strategic insights with 4 visual encodings

### TAM Formatting
- **Issues**: Text duplication, formatting inconsistencies, dollar signs in wrong places
- **Solutions**: Comprehensive regex patterns, duplicate removal, uniform styling
- **Result**: Clean, professional 2-box display with dynamic values

### Currency Standardization
- **Implementation**: USD conversion at Claude API level
- **Display**: Automatic $ and USD formatting
- **Coverage**: TAM, segment sizes, competitor funding

### Deployment Issues
- **Fixed**: Matplotlib dependency error (removed background_gradient)
- **Fixed**: Git repository setup and Streamlit Cloud deployment
- **Result**: Stable, working deployment
